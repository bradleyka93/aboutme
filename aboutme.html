  <p>The series revolves around four older, single women (three widows and one divorc√©e)
    sharing a house in Miami, Florida. The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux
    (Rue McClanahan), Zbornak (Bea Arthur). They both responded to a room-for-rent ad on the bulletin
    board of a local grocery store. In the pilot episode, the women had a gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin),
    who was subsequently removed.[5] The three were soon joined by Dorothy's mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty),
    after the retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.</p>
  <p>Thank You for being a friend. Travel down a road and back again. Your heart is true, you're a pal and a confidante.
    And if you threw a party, invited everyone you knew, you would see the biggest gift would be from me and the card
    attached would say, Thank You For Being a Friend!</p>
